2 Load the VQE artifacts and sanity-check dimensions
Read the tapered Hamiltonian:
Use pickle.load(open("inputs/bk_symm_tapered.pkl", "rb")) (OpenFermion QubitOperator).

Load the optimized parameters:
params = np.load("results/advanced_benchmarking/kupccgsd_vqe/adam/final_params.npy")

Infer the number of qubits and parameter shape:

qubits = count_qubits(qubit_op) (OpenFermion helper).

Check params.shape matches PennyLane’s k-UpCCGSD weights requirement (shape (k, n_params) where k is the repetition count) 
PennyLane Documentation
.
If the shape is wrong, revisit the original training script to confirm how many repetitions k and how many excitations were used.

3 Reconstruct the k-UpCCGSD circuit
Build the Hartree–Fock (HF) reference state for your active-space electron count.

Wrap the PennyLane template

python
Copy
Edit
def ansatz(weights, wires, excitations, hf_state):
    qml.BasisState(hf_state, wires=wires)
    qml.kUpCCGSD(weights, wires=wires,
                 sD_settings={"excitations": excitations, "k": k})
Plug in params from step 2 and the excitation list obtained from your VQE notebook (saved during training).

4 Choose an IonQ execution path
4.1 Direct PennyLane device (quickest path)
python
Copy
Edit
dev = qml.device("ionq.simulator", wires=qubits)   # ideal, noiseless
The device is ideal and gate-set-agnostic; no transpilation needed 
PennyLane
. For remote QPU access replace with ionq.qpu, choose an available backend such as "aria-1" and keep your API key in the environment 
PennyLane Documentation
.

4.2 Qiskit-IonQ provider (if you prefer Qiskit)
python
Copy
Edit
from qiskit_ionq import IonQProvider
provider = IonQProvider()             # reads IONQ_API_KEY
backend  = provider.get_backend("simulator")
Submit an assembled QuantumCircuit with backend.run(circuit, shots=…) 
IonQ Documentation
GitHub
.

4.3 Noise-model simulation (optional realism)
IonQ’s cloud offers a hardware noise model simulator that injects Aria- or Harmony-specific noise fingerprints into the circuit; specify backend "simulator" and the JSON flag "noise_model": "aria-1" when using the REST API or the Qiskit provider 
ionq.com
.

5 Integrate Fire Opal error-suppression
Verify Fire Opal installation: pip install fire-opal (already done).

Authenticate:

import fireopal as fo
fo.authenticate_qctrl_account(api_key=os.getenv("QCTRL_API_KEY"))
Wrap the backend:

mitigated_backend = fo.qiskit.fireopal_backend(backend)
fireopal_backend automatically injects AI-driven gate-level suppression before the job is submitted 
Q-CTRL Documentation

.
4. For IonQ hardware via Braket: Fire Opal offers a ready-made Braket helper (fo.braket.fireopal_device("ionq.forte")), following the tutorial in the “Get started on IonQ through Amazon Braket” notebook 
Q-CTRL Documentation
.

Fire Opal has demonstrated up to 2×–2.5× fidelity boosts on IonQ devices for algorithms such as QFT and QPE

6 Run and validate
Construct a QNode (PennyLane) or QuantumCircuit (Qiskit) with the ansatz + measurement of the Hamiltonian expectation.

Execute on your chosen backend with ~10 000 shots for stable chemistry energies.

Compare the returned energy to the training energy recorded in your VQE log. For the ideal simulator the values should agree to machine precision; with noise and Fire Opal suppression expect a small, mitigated deviation (tens of mHa).
